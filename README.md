# How to play
 - Visit Project Page:Â https://jasonashimine.github.io/Web-TD/

### Game play:
 - Build towers in a buildable area.

 - Cost 10 gold and 3x3 size.
 - Monsters will automatically spawn when the wave is complete (all monsters die or leave the map).
 - More monsters/gold every wave
 - You have 10 lives. i.e., can let 10 monsters through.

*You can pause the game with the "space bar."*

*Currently, it has a debug console and some dev keys; please ignore them for now.*

### Goals of the project

Quick prototype for creating a Web Tower defense game. The initial goal was to create a framework and workflow from scratch using TypeScript, Vectors, Sprites, and Canvas.

Tiled for creating a map and pathway. Vite Vanilla for development.

 - Produced a web-based tower defense game using Canvas.
 - Develop a game engine framework and workflow.
 - Animated Pixel Sprites and Towers.
 - AI follows predetermined waypoints.
 - Vector-based movement.
 - Handle automatic tower attacks and trigger areas.
 - Stacked Canvas for BG, Game, and UI to avoid redraws.
 - JSON data files for easier expandability.
 - Scaling enemies/gold per wave

### Eventual goals to refine the project.
 - TODO: Refine the game engine to be more modular.
 - TODO: Remove the debug log.
 - TODO: Add more enemy types.
 - TODO: Fix scalling.
 - TODO: Add more buildings and upgrade system.
